# From 11/7/22 discord messaging between Jed and Chanho....

# Jed:Looking at test organization another way, it would be the simplifying in a number of aspects if I
# make each test set be equivalent to the situation count, where the color palette is randomly chosen
# for each situation - i.e. just treat novelty as a different situation just like TA2 does.   This would mean,
# just like the eval, we would have 50 test sets where each test has every situation represented , but rather
# than having a consistent color palette, each scene in each test would have it's color palette assigned using
#  a random draw.   The notion of a "test" would remain somewhat consistent with the eval, the size of each set
# would be small enough that running an additional set wouldn't take as long.  So, if the three projects are in
# contention, for example, and we have some hours before the inter tests need to start, for example, we could
# continue running scenes and finish another set.
# So this would mean, regardless of whether or not novelty was represented in the hypercubes for that scene type,
# it would always be:

# for color in random_draw(colors)
#        for situation in all_situations

# to construct each test set, and there would be 50  test sets defined.  Each cycle, we'd get through as many
# of those as we had time for.   Each set would have 133 scenes broken down like this:

# coll    24
# grav   30
# sc       10
# stc     24
# op      45

#  REASON_FOR_EXCLUDING_SOME_OP_SCENES_FROM_OPTICS_TEST
#  The one issue I see is that op scenes are much greater in number than the others - op has three dimensions of
# novelty  -  there are actually only 15 situations where dynamics vary.  I could omit the size novelty scenes,
# which would bring that count down to 30, which would make each set 118.  This would better balance the scene
# counts in each set and still cover all situation dynamics

# Chanho â€” 11/07/2022
# This sounds good to me. I also agree with your last point to better balance different scene types by decreasing
# the dimensions of novelty for OP.
